# Daily Voice Notes & Task Planner

Capture quick voice memos and turn them into a prioritized daily to-do list—all in your browser.

## Features

- **Voice notes** – Record, title, and annotate your audio clips. Notes are stored locally in your browser so they are ready the next time you open the app.
- **Task planning** – Add tasks with helpful context, mark them complete, and automatically sort them by priority.
- **Voice-to-task bridge** – Promote any voice memo into a high-priority task with one click, keeping both items linked.
- **Offline-friendly** – Everything runs client-side with no server required.

## Getting started

1. Open `index.html` in a modern desktop browser (Chrome, Edge, or Firefox recommended).
2. Grant microphone access the first time you record a note.
3. Start capturing memos and building your task list!

> **Tip:** Because data is stored in `localStorage`, clearing your browser storage or switching browsers/devices will reset your notes and tasks.
